 * foot, the middle of that underside, on the point. The leading part lines up with the face as a
 * new shape dropped there would, keeping only its own turn about its up axis - so its edges run
 * along the face's edges instead of standing askew after a shortest turn. Only the angles and
 * the place of each part change: nothing is baked.
